# Blackjack-Helper
Blackjack helper that helps the user make decisions as well as counts cards (not used for profit). (Python, Pandas, CSVs)

-Developed a blackjack strategy bot that advises users on optimal gameplay actions based on "the book" of basic blackjack strategy; utilized the pandas library to extract these strategies from a CSV file, ensuring accurate and quick recommendations.

-Implemented a card-counting feature within the code that tracks both the running and true counts of the cards dealt; this allows the bot to calculate and suggest the optimal betting amount for upcoming hands based on the count.

-Conducted thorough testing of the code in a simulated environment to validate functionality and performance; the project was designed for educational purposes and to enhance understanding of programming, not for profit or real gambling.
